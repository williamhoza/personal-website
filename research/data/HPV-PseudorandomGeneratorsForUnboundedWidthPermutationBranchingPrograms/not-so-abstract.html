  A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots$ that "appear random" in some sense. In this paper, we present a pseudorandom generator that is designed for the following type of scenario. Imagine a machine $A$ that reads the bits $x_1, x_2, \dots$ one at a time, in order. Each time it reads a bit, $A$ updates its internal state. The only assumption we make is that $A$ is "reversible," meaning there exists a machine $B$ such that if $B$ starts in $A$'s final state and $B$ reads the same bits in backward order, then $B$ passes through the exact same sequence of states (in backward order). Under this assumption, we prove that when $A$ reads the output of our generator, the probability that it ends up in any particular state is approximately the same as if $x_1, x_2, \dots$ were truly random bits. Our generator is "near-optimal" in terms of the number of coin tosses it makes.
