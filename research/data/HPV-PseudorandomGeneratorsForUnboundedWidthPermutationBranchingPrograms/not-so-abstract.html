  A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits \(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\) that "appear random" in some sense. In this paper, we present a pseudorandom generator that is designed for the following type of scenario. Imagine a machine \(A\) that reads the bits \(x_1, x_2, \dots\) one at a time, in order. Each time it reads a bit, \(A\) updates its internal state. The only assumption we make is that \(A\) is "reversible," meaning there exists a machine \(B\) such that if \(B\) starts in \(A\)'s final state and \(B\) reads the same bits in backward order, then \(B\) passes through the exact same sequence of states (in backward order). Under this assumption, we prove that when \(A\) reads the output of our generator, the probability that it ends up in any particular state is approximately the same as if \(x_1, x_2, \dots\) were truly random bits. Our generator is "near-optimal" in terms of the number of coin tosses it makes.
