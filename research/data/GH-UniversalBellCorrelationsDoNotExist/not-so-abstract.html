  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell's theorem</a> says that (roughly) given the laws of quantum mechanics, it follows that two parties can interact instantaneously across arbitrary distances. This phenomenon ("quantum nonlocality") is amazing, but the nature of the "interactions" is notoriously subtle. Quantum nonlocality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem">provably cannot be used to <em>communicate</em></a>, but it can be used to <em>coordinate</em> in certain surprising ways.

  In this paper, we rule out one possible approach to characterizing the exact extent of the "nonlocal powers" granted by the laws of quantum mechanics. In particular, aside from quantum nonlocality, another situation in which two parties can interact in a limited way is if there is some discrete, classical device that each party is able to interact with. We prove that quantum nonlocality is <em>not quite equivalent</em> to any such discrete, classical device.
