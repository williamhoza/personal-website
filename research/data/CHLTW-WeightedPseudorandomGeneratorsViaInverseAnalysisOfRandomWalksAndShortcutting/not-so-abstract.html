  A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits that "appear random" in some sense. A "weighted pseudorandom generator" is similar, except instead of working with actual probabilities, we work with "pseudoprobabilities," which are allowed to be positive or negative. Pseudoprobability is a little strange, but it turns out that for some purposes, weighted pseudorandom generators are just as useful as ordinary pseudorandom generators â€” and sometimes they are easier to design. This paper presents some new weighted pseudorandom generators that improve over prior work in terms of the number of coin tosses that they make.
