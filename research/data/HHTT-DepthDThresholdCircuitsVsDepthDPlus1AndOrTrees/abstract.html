  For any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $d = o(\log \log n)$, we prove that there is a Boolean function $F$ on $n$ bits and a value $\gamma = 2^{-\Theta(d)}$ such that $F$ can be computed by a uniform depth-$(d + 1)$ $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuit with $O(n)$ wires, but $F$ cannot be computed by any depth-$d$ $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuit with $n^{1 + \gamma}$ wires. This bound matches the current state-of-the-art lower bounds for computing explicit functions by threshold circuits of depth $d > 2$, which were previously known only for functions outside $\mathsf{AC}^0$ such as the parity function. Furthermore, in our result, the $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuit computing $F$ is a monotone <em>read-once formula</em> (i.e., an ${\mathsf{AND}\text{-}\mathsf{OR}}$ tree), and the lower bound holds even in the average-case setting with respect to advantage $n^{-\gamma}$.

  At a high level, our proof strategy combines two prominent approaches in circuit complexity from the last decade: The celebrated <em>random projections</em> method of Håstad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan (J. ACM 2017), which was previously used to show a tight average-case depth hierarchy for $\mathsf{AC}^0$; and the line of works analyzing the effect of <em>random restrictions</em> on threshold circuits.  We show that under a modified version of Håstad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan's projection procedure, any depth-$d$ threshold circuit with $n^{1 + \gamma}$ wires simplifies to a near-trivial function, whereas an appropriately parameterized ${\mathsf{AND}\text{-}\mathsf{OR}}$ tree of depth $d + 1$ maintains structure.
