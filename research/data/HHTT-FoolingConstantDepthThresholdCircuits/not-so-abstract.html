  This paper is mainly about "threshold circuits", which can be thought of as a crude mathematical model of a brain. A threshold circuit is a network of "threshold gates" (analogous to neurons) connected by "wires" (analogous to axons). Each gate computes a weighted sum of its inputs; it outputs 0 or 1 depending on whether the weighted sum is above some threshold. (The reason we're interested in this model is that it comes up naturally in theoretical computer science, not because we're trying to understand actual brains, but still, it's nice to think of it as a brain.)

  Our contribution is a "pseudorandom generator" for threshold circuits. In general, a pseudorandom generator is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits that "appear random" in some sense. The output of our pseudorandom generator provably cannot be distinguished from a truly random sequence by any threshold circuit, assuming the circuit is "shallow" (i.e., paths from the input wires to the output wire are short) and assuming there aren't too many wires in total.
