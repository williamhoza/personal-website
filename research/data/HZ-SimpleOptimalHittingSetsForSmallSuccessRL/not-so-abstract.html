  In this paper, we present a set of binary strings \(H\) with the following guarantee. Suppose \(P\) is a property of binary strings such that a decent fraction of all binary strings have property \(P\). Suppose also that there is some algorithm for determining whether a given string \(x\) has property \(P\), using a small amount of memory and reading \(x\) just once from left to right. Then some string in \(H\) has property \(P\). Our set \(H\) is smaller than any such set discovered previously.
