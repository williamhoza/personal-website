  In this paper, we present a set of binary strings $H$ with the following guarantee. Suppose $P$ is a property of binary strings such that a decent fraction of all binary strings have property $P$. Suppose also that there is some algorithm for determining whether a given string $x$ has property $P$, using a small amount of memory and reading $x$ just once from left to right. Then some string in $H$ has property $P$. Our set $H$ is smaller than any such set discovered previously.
