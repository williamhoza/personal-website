  A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits that "appear random" in some sense. A "weighted pseudorandom generator" is similar, except instead of working with actual probabilities, we work with "pseudoprobabilities," which are allowed to be negative or bigger than 1. Pseudoprobability is a little strange, but it turns out that for some purposes, weighted pseudorandom generators are just as useful as ordinary pseudorandom generators â€” and sometimes they are easier to design. This paper presents a weighted pseudorandom generator whose output can be used in place of truly random bits for any low-memory randomized computation. The generator is a little better than prior work in some cases in terms of the number of coin tosses it makes.
