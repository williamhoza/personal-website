  Quantum algorithms are algorithms that exploit quantum effects, requiring special hardware that, broadly speaking, nobody has managed to build yet. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for two types of problems. In the first type of problem, Alice has some data $x$, Bob has some data $y$, and the two of them would like to figure out whether the pair $(x, y)$ has some property $P$ using as little communication as possible. For example, maybe $x$ and $y$ are numbers between 1 and a million, and $P$ is the property that $x > y$. The second type of problem is similar to the game 20 Questions. Alice chooses $x$. If Bob specifies $y$, then Alice tells him whether $(x, y)$ has property $P$. Bob's goal is to learn $x$ by making as few queries as possible. We prove that if the same property $P$ is used to formulate each problem, then the two problems can't both have extremely efficient quantum algorithms.
