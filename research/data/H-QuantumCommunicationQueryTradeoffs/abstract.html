  For any function \(f \colon X \times Y \to Z\), we prove that
  \[
    Q^{*\text{cc}}(f) \cdot Q^{\text{OIP}}(f) \cdot (\log Q^{\text{OIP}}(f) + \log |Z|) \geq \Omega(\log |X|).
  \]
  Here, \(Q^{*\text{cc}}(f)\) denotes the bounded-error communication complexity of \(f\) using an entanglement-assisted two-way qubit channel, and \(Q^{\text{OIP}}(f)\) denotes the number of quantum queries needed to learn \(x\) with high probability given oracle access to the function \(f_x(y) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} f(x, y)\). We show that this tradeoff is close to the best possible. We also give a generalization of this tradeoff for <em>distributional</em> query complexity.
  
  As an application, we prove an optimal \(\Omega(\log q)\) lower bound on the \(Q^{*\text{cc}}\) complexity of determining whether \(x + y\) is a perfect square, where Alice holds \(x \in \mathbb{F}_q\), Bob holds \(y \in \mathbb{F}_q\), and \(\mathbb{F}_q\) is a finite field of odd characteristic. As another application, we give a new, simpler proof that searching an ordered size-\(N\) database requires \(\Omega(\log N / \log \log N)\) quantum queries. (It was already known that \(\Theta(\log N)\) queries are required.)
