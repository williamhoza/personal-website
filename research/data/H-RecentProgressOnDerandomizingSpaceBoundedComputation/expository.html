    <a href="https://youtu.be/M7VJN6HysoE">Video</a> from my presentation at the Institute for Advanced Study Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics Seminar (November 2023). Here are the <a href="ias-slides.pptx">slides</a> from that presentation. See also <a href="warwick-slides.pptx">these slides</a> from my earlier presentation for the University of Warwick Complexity Meetings (November 2022), which follow the article more closely. I used very similar slides for presentations at the University of Michigan Theory Seminar (November 2022), the Columbia Theory Seminar (March 2022), and Oberwolfach Meeting 2146 on Complexity Theory (November 2021). Note: The presentation predates the article.
