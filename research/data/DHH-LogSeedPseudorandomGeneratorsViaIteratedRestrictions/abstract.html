  There are only a few known general approaches for constructing explicit pseudorandom generators (PRGs). The "iterated restrictions" approach, pioneered by Ajtai and Wigderson (Advances in Computing Research '89), has provided PRGs with seed length $\text{polylog } n$ or even $\widetilde{O}(\log n)$ for several restricted models of computation. Can this approach ever achieve the optimal seed length of $O(\log n)$?

  In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative. Using the iterated restrictions approach, we construct an explicit PRG for <em>read-once depth-2 $\mathbf{AC}^0[\oplus]$ formulas</em> with seed length
  $$
    O(\log n) + \widetilde{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon)).
  $$
  In particular, our PRG achieves optimal seed length $O(\log n)$ with near-optimal error $\varepsilon = \exp(-\widetilde{\Omega}(\log n))$. Even for constant error, the best prior PRG for this model (which includes read-once CNFs and read-once $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomials) has seed length $\Theta(\log n \cdot (\log \log n)^2)$ (Lee, CCC '19).

  A key step in the analysis of our PRG is a tail bound for <em>subset-wise symmetric polynomials</em>, a generalization of elementary symmetric polynomials. Like elementary symmetric polynomials, subset-wise symmetric polynomials provide a way to organize the expansion of $\prod_{i = 1}^m (1 + y_i)$. Elementary symmetric polynomials simply organize the terms by <em>degree</em>, i.e., they keep track of the number of variables participating in each monomial. Subset-wise symmetric polynomials keep track of more data: for a fixed partition of $[m]$, they keep track of the number of variables <em>from each subset</em> participating in each monomial. Our tail bound extends prior work by Gopalan and Yehudayoff (arXiv 2014) on elementary symmetric polynomials.
