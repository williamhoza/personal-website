  Suppose a language \(L\) can be decided by a bounded-error randomized algorithm that runs in space \(S\) and time \(n \cdot \text{poly}(S)\). We give a randomized algorithm for \(L\) that still runs in space \(O(S)\) and time \(n \cdot \text{poly}(S)\) that uses only \(O(S)\) random bits; our algorithm has a low failure probability on all but a negligible fraction of inputs of each length. As an immediate corollary, there is a deterministic algorithm for \(L\) that runs in space \(O(S)\) and succeeds on all but a negligible fraction of inputs of each length. We also give several other complexity-theoretic applications of our technique.
