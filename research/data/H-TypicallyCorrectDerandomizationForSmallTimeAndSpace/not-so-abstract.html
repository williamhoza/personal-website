  A "randomized" algorithm tosses coins to make decisions, whereas a "deterministic" algorithm doesn't use any randomness. Most theoretical computer scientists believe that if a problem can be solved by a randomized algorithm, then it can also be solved by a deterministic algorithm that uses about the same amount of time and memory. But nobody knows how to prove it. In this paper, we prove that if a problem can be solved by a fast randomized algorithm, then it can also be solved by a deterministic algorithm that uses about the same amount of memory, with the caveat that the deterministic algorithm might give the wrong answer on a tiny fraction of inputs.
