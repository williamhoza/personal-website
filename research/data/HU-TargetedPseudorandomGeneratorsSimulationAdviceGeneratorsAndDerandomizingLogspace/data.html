<data value="VERSION-SUMMARY">
  We posted a manuscript online in October 2016; I presented the preliminary version of the paper at STOC in June 2017; the journal version was published in the SICOMP special section for STOC 2017 in April 2022. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/17M1145707">SICOMP version</a> (<a href="SICOMP-version.pdf">pdf</a>) has several minor improvements compared to the STOC proceedings version and the arXiv version, including fixing a minor error. The latter two versions are the same except for formatting.

<data value="ABSTRACT">
  <p>
    Assume that for every derandomization result for logspace algorithms, there is a pseudorandom generator strong enough to nearly recover the derandomization by iterating over all seeds and taking a majority vote. We prove under a precise version of this assumption that $\mathbf{BPL} \subseteq \bigcap_{\alpha > 0} \mathbf{DSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)$.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We strengthen the theorem to an equivalence by considering two generalizations of the concept of a pseudorandom generator against logspace. A <em>targeted pseudorandom generator</em> against logspace takes as input a short uniform random seed <em>and</em> a finite automaton; it outputs a long bitstring that looks random to that particular automaton. A <em>simulation advice generator</em> for logspace stretches a small uniform random seed into a long advice string; the requirement is that there is some logspace algorithm that, given a finite automaton and this advice string, simulates the automaton reading a long uniform random input. We prove that $$ \bigcap_{\alpha > 0} \mathbf{promise\text{-}BPSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n) = \bigcap_{\alpha > 0} \mathbf{promise\text{-}DSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)$$ if and only if for every targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace, there is a simulation advice generator for logspace with similar parameters.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, we observe that in a certain <em>uniform</em> setting (namely, if we only worry about sequences of automata that can be generated in logspace), targeted pseudorandom generators against logspace <em>can</em> be transformed into simulation advice generators with similar parameters.

    There's a well-known conjecture in complexity theory ("$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}$") that says that randomness isn't necessary for solving problems using a small amount of computer memory. The most promising approach to proving this conjecture is to design a suitable kind of "pseudorandom generator". But in principle, one could hope to prove $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}$ using a totally different approach. In this paper, we prove a theorem that can be roughly stated as follows. If every true statement along the lines of $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}$ can be proven using the pseudorandom generator approach, then in fact $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}$ (actually the conclusion is slightly weaker).
