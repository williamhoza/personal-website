  Assume that for every derandomization result for logspace algorithms, there is a pseudorandom generator strong enough to nearly recover the derandomization by iterating over all seeds and taking a majority vote. We prove under a precise version of this assumption that \(\mathbf{BPL} \subseteq \bigcap_{\alpha > 0} \mathbf{DSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)\).

  We strengthen the theorem to an equivalence by considering two generalizations of the concept of a pseudorandom generator against logspace. A <em>targeted pseudorandom generator</em> against logspace takes as input a short uniform random seed <em>and</em> a finite automaton; it outputs a long bitstring that looks random to that particular automaton. A <em>simulation advice generator</em> for logspace stretches a small uniform random seed into a long advice string; the requirement is that there is some logspace algorithm that, given a finite automaton and this advice string, simulates the automaton reading a long uniform random input. We prove that \[ \bigcap_{\alpha > 0} \mathbf{promise\text{-}BPSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n) = \bigcap_{\alpha > 0} \mathbf{promise\text{-}DSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)\] if and only if for every targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace, there is a simulation advice generator for logspace with similar parameters.

  Finally, we observe that in a certain <em>uniform</em> setting (namely, if we only worry about sequences of automata that can be generated in logspace), targeted pseudorandom generators against logspace <em>can</em> be transformed into simulation advice generators with similar parameters.
