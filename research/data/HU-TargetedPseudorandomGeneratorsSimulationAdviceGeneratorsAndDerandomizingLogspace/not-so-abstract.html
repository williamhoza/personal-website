  There's a well-known conjecture in complexity theory ("\(\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}\)") that says that randomness isn't necessary for solving problems using a small amount of computer memory. The most promising approach to proving this conjecture is to design a suitable kind of "pseudorandom generator". But in principle, one could hope to prove \(\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}\) using a totally different approach. In this paper, we prove a theorem that can be roughly stated as follows. If every true statement along the lines of \(\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}\) can be proven using the pseudorandom generator approach, then in fact \(\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}\) (actually the conclusion is slightly weaker).
