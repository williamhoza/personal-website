  Suppose you have a randomized algorithm that estimates some numeric quantity, and you plan to use it \(k\) times. Suppose the estimation algorithm makes \(n\) coin tosses. This situation seems to call for \(nk\) coin tosses in total. In this paper, we show that you can actually get away with only making about \(n + k\) coin tosses if you use some tricks.
