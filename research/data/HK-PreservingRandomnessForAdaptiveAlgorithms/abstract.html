  Suppose \(\mathsf{Est}\) is a randomized estimation algorithm that uses \(n\) random bits and outputs values in \(\mathbb{R}^d\). We show how to execute \(\mathsf{Est}\) on \(k\) adaptively chosen inputs using only \(n + O(k \log(d + 1))\) random bits instead of the trivial \(nk\) (at the cost of mild increases in the error and failure probability). Our algorithm combines a variant of the INW pseudorandom generator (STOC '94) with a new scheme for shifting and rounding the outputs of \(\mathsf{Est}\). We prove that modifying the outputs of \(\mathsf{Est}\) is necessary in this setting, and furthermore, our algorithm's randomness complexity is near-optimal in the case \(d \leq O(1)\). As an application, we give a randomness-efficient version of the Goldreich-Levin algorithm; our algorithm finds all Fourier coefficients with absolute value at least \(\theta\) of a function \(F \colon \{0, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}\) using \(O(n \log n) \cdot \text{poly}(1/\theta)\) queries to \(F\) and \(O(n)\) random bits (independent of \(\theta\)), improving previous work by Bshouty et al. (JCSS '04).
