<h2>
  Background
</h2>

<p>
  Pictionary is a classic game in which players try to guess what
  other players are drawing. Quintessentially, Pictionary
  is played by two teams of two players (one teammate draws while
  the other teammate guesses.)
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/pictionary.pdf">Hasbro's
  official Pictionary rules</a> also describe a "three-player" version
  of the game. In Hasbro's "three-player" game, one player is designated
  as the artist for the entire game; the other two players compete
  to win by guessing. Hasbro's game has some merits, but the
  poor artist can hardly be considered a "player" in the game. Hasbro's game is
  more like a <em>two</em>-player guessing game.
</p>

<p>
  In this blog post, we describe a Pictionary variant with no teams
  in which every player has a shot at winning. Our game is
  designed for three players, but it also works with more than
  three players.
</p>
        
<h2>
  How to play our game
</h2>

<p>
  Necessary materials:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A source of words (e.g. the cards from the original Pictionary game)
    </li>
    <li>
      A drawing surface that everyone can see
    </li>
    <li>
      A one-minute timer
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Gameplay:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In each round, one player is the artist and all other
      players are guessers.
    </li>
    <li>
      The artist gets a word from the word source and spends up 
      to one minute drawing it. (Standard Pictionary rules apply: 
      no alphabet symbols, no gestures, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If a guesser correctly identifies the word, the round is over.
      The successful guesser and the artist each get one point.
      (In the rare event that multiple guessers correctly identify
      the word simultaneously, each successful guesser gets one
      point.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If none of the guessers identify the word within one 
      minute, the round is over and nobody gets any points.
    </li>
    <li>
      Players take turns being the artist <strong>with one
      exception</strong>: if it would be your turn to draw, but your 
      score is <strong>strictly</strong> greater than each of the other 
      players' scores, then you are "ineligible to draw" and your 
      turn is skipped.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Winning:
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you have at least 9 points and you have <strong>strictly</strong> 
      more points than each other player at the beginning of a 
      round, then you are "eligible to win" during that round.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you get a point in a round in which you are eligible to 
      win and no other guessers get points in that round, then 
      the game is over and <strong>you win!</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Example: At the beginning of a round, A has 7 points, B has 
      8 points, and C has 9 points. B draws and C successfully 
      guesses the word. The game is over. The final scores are (7, 
      9, 10) and C wins. This example demonstrates that the win 
      condition is <strong>not</strong> simply "game to 10, win by two."
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
        
<h2>
  Discussion
</h2>

<p>
  The reader may wonder why our rules are so complicated. For the 
  sake of discussion, let's consider some simpler rules, focusing 
  on the three-player case. Let's imagine a game where players 
  take turns being the artist; the artist and guesser each get 
  one point when the the word is successfully identified; the 
  first player to 10 points wins the game. To handle <strong>ties</strong>, 
  we'd better stipulate that the game continues until some player 
  has strictly more points than each other player.
</p>

<p>
  These simple rules have a serious defect: in some situations, a 
  player <strong>knows that he or she will not win</strong> even though the 
  game isn't over. For example, suppose the scores are (8, 9, 9). 
  It's impossible for A to win, because if A ever gets a point, 
  then so does either B or C.
</p>

<p>
  To fix this defect, let's change the winning condition. Let's 
  say the game continues until some player has at least 10 points 
  and is ahead by a margin of at least two points ("game to 10, 
  win by two"). These rules still have some serious defects:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In some situations, <strong>one guesser doesn't want to 
      guess.</strong> Suppose the scores are (7, 9, 8) and B is the 
      artist. If A successfully guesses the word, the game will
      end and B will win, whereas if C successfully guesses the
      word, the game will continue. So A would rather wait until
      C is the artist to guess.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even worse, in some situations, <strong>neither guesser wants to 
      guess!</strong> Suppose the scores are (5, 6, 9) and C is 
      drawing. If A or B correctly guesses the word, they'll 
      immediately lose! They'd rather wait until one of them is 
      the artist.
    </li>
    <li>
      In some situations, <strong>the artist doesn't want to draw.</strong>
      Suppose the scores are (7, 8, 9) and A is the artist. If A
      draws, there's a risk that C might correctly guess the word
      and win the game. On the other hand, A can just wait for B's
      turn as artist. When B draws, even if C successfully guesses
      the word, the scores will be (7, 9, 10) and the game will
      continue.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Our rules avoid all these defects:
  <ul>
    <li>
      With our rules, <strong>there can never be a tie.</strong> After all, in
      each round, at most one player is eligible to win.
    </li>
    <li>
      With our rules, <strong>if the game isn't over, any player might 
      win.</strong> Indeed, no matter what's happened so far, you'll 
      win if from now on, whenever you're a guesser, you 
      successfully guess the word, and whenever you're the 
      artist, the guesser with fewest points successfully guesses 
      the word.
    </li>
    <li>
      With our rules, <strong>it's always reasonable for all guessers 
      to guess</strong>. After all, if another player is eligible to
      win, guessing will <em>prevent</em> that player from winning.
    </li>
    <li>
      With our rules, <strong>it's always reasonable for the artist to 
      draw</strong>. After all, if a guesser is eligible to win, that 
      guesser will still be eligible to win next round if you 
      refrain from drawing. You're going to have to get points 
      eventually if you want to ever win.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Admittedly, even with our rules, there are still some contrived 
  scenarios in which someone might choose to not guess or choose 
  to not draw. For example, the two guessers might feel that the 
  artist is actually much better than they are and is only 
  eligible to draw due to bad luck, so they might refrain from 
  guessing. For another example, suppose A is the artist and B is 
  eligible to win. A might feel that B is particularly good at 
  guessing A's drawings and A is particularly good at guessing 
  C's drawings. A might therefore choose to not draw. In 
  practice, we haven't encountered these issues.

  We hope you enjoy our game!
