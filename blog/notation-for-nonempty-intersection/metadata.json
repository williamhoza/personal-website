If A and B are sets, then A \\cap B is \"the intersection\" of A and B, i.e., the set of all x such that x \\in A and x \\in B. It's the middle part of a Venn diagram. That's all well and good, but I'm talking about the intersection *relation*. We say that A \"intersects\" B if there *exists* some x such that x \\in A and x \\in B.",
