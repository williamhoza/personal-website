If A and B are sets, then \"the intersection\" of A and B, denoted A \\cap B, is the set of all x such that x \\in A and x \\in B. It's the middle part of a Venn diagram. That's fine, but I'm talking about the intersection *relation*. We say that A \"intersects\" B if there exists some x such that x \\in A and x \\in B.",
