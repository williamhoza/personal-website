From that tree you shall not eat; when you eat from it you shall die.' (Genesis 2:16-17) In the story of the Fall, God forbids eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Until recently, I took it for granted that God forbids eating the fruit because of the knowledge the fruit imparts. In my defense, there are some important Christian theologians who interpret the story in a similar way, such as St. Theophilus of Antioch and St. Gregory of Nazianzus. However, according to other luminaries such as St. John Chrysostom and St. Augustine of Hippo, the correct interpretation is the other way around. The fruit imparts knowledge only because the fruit is forbidden!",
