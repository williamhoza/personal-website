  [This blog post was originally a standalone webpage I wrote sometime 
  in 2016. I edited it a tiny bit for the blog. It's satire, intended 
  to poke fun at lists of "contradictions" in the bible. The apparent 
  contradictions in these theorems can all be resolved.]

  Sorry, matheists, but every thinking person admits that abstract 
  objects don't exist. Math is just a fairy tale invented by professors 
  to control their grad students. Pathetically, the fairy tale isn't 
  even internally consistent:
</p>

<h4>
  1. <a href="http://www.dcs.fmph.uniba.sk/~pardubska/RA/IP=PSPACE-shamir.pdf">A theorem by Shamir</a>
  says that \(\mathbf{IP} = \mathbf{PSPACE}\), but <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000005800844">a theorem by Chang et al.</a> says that there exists an oracle \(A\) such that \(\mathbf{IP}^A \neq \mathbf{PSPACE}^A\).
</h4>

<p class="note">
  Every middle school student knows that if you do the same thing to 
  both sides of an equation, it stays an equation! So much for 
  matheists' doctrine of "theorem inerrancy".
</p>

<h4>
  2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell's 
  theorem</a> says that through quantum entanglement, objects can 
  instantaneously affect each other across arbitrary distances. But the 
  <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem">no-communication 
  theorem</a> says the opposite: acting on a quantum system has no 
  effect on any entangled systems.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  What's more, the no-communication theorem is just plagiarized from 
  physicists! One of the laws of special relativity says you can't send 
  a signal faster than the speed of light. Sound familiar?
</p>

<h4>
  3. Supposedly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...">0.999... = 1</a>.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  If matheists learned how to use logic, they would immediately see how silly this is.
</p>

<h4>
  4. <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem">Taylor's 
  theorem</a> says that every infinitely differentiable function can be 
  expanded as a Taylor series, but the Taylor series of \(\exp(-1/x^2)\) 
  around zero is identically zero.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  Matheists only buy this stuff because of scare tactics. They're told 
  that if they don't believe the theorems, they will not receive 
  eternal employment.
</p>

<h4>
  5. <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/23/4/10.1119/1.1933957">A theorem by Johnson</a> says that it takes \(\exp(\Omega(d))\) books to build a stack that leans over distance \(d\). But <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Robbins/Patterson1.pdf">a theorem by Paterson and Zwick</a> says \(O(d^3)\) books suffice.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  Don't those dumb matheists realize that polynomials grow slower than exponentials?
</p>

<h4>
  6. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">The 
  law of large numbers</a> says that if you keep sampling a probability 
  distribution, the sample average converges to the expectation. But <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution#Properties">a 
  theorem by Poisson</a> says that if you sample from the standard 
  Cauchy distribution, the sample average still follows the standard 
  Cauchy distribution.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  More like the rule of thumb of large numbers, am I right?
</p>

<h4>
  7. <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%27s_theorem">Cayley's 
  theorem</a> says that every finite group is a subgroup of \(S_n\) for 
  some \(n\). That means there are only countably many finite groups. 
  But there are uncountably many distinct regular polygons (since there 
  are uncountably many side lengths by <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_of_the_continuum">a 
  theorem of Cantor</a>), and each has a finite group of symmetries.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  Connect the dots, sheeple. It's not that hard.
</p>

<h4>
  8. <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem">Gödel's 
  completeness theorem</a> says that the standard axioms of logic are 
  enough for any proof; no axioms are missing. But <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel's 
  incompleteness theorem</a> says that there does not exist a complete 
  list of axioms; there are always missing axioms.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  The contradiction is right there in the names of the theorems! Maybe 
  matheists would see it if they weren't so brainwashed by the sermons 
  they're always listening to in classrooms.
</p>

<h4>
  9. <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/measure_theory/measure_notes_ch2.pdf">A standard theorem of Euclidean geometry</a> says that if two solids are congruent, then they have the same volume. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox">Banach-Tarski paradox</a> says that you can cut a unit ball into five pieces and rearrange them into two disjoint unit balls.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  Let me guess: this theorem was "taken out of context"?
</p>

<h4>
  10. <a 
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%27s_zero%E2%80%93one_law">Kolmogorov's 
  zero-one law</a> implies that either 100% of numbers have terminating 
  decimal expansions or else 0% of numbers have terminating decimal 
  expansions. But some numbers (like 1/2) do and others (like 1/3) 
  don't.
</h4>

<p class="note">
  Remember, just because some old guys published some proofs, that 
  doesn't make a theorem absolute truth.
