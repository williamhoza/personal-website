        Gender Reveal Bingo
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a tool for setting up a gender reveal party. At the party, guests divide into two teams ("Team Girl" and "Team Boy") and play a game of bingo. The game is rigged: if the baby is a girl, someone on Team Girl will win; if the baby is a boy, someone on Team Boy will win.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to use this tool:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When you are with your doctor (or someone else who knows the sex of your baby), load <a href="get-link">this webpage</a> on a phone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have your doctor (or whoever) press a button on that webpage indicating the sex of the baby.
        </li>
        <li>
          That webpage will generate a custom link that you can use to print bingo cards before the party and run the game on the day of the party.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note that the parents do not need to learn the sex of the baby prior to the gender reveal party.
      </p>

        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am a fallible programmer. If I made a mistake in my programming, it could ruin your gender reveal party. I did try to be careful. My wife and I used it at a gender reveal party for her pregnancy and nothing went wrong, but I cannot make any promises. Use at your own risk!
