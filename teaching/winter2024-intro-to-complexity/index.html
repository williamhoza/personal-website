        <p>
          <em>Collaboration.</em> You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on problem sets, but you must adhere to the following rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work on each problem on your own for at least ten minutes before discussing it with classmates.</li>
          <li>Write your solution on your own. While you are writing your solution, do not consult any notes that you might have taken during discussions with classmates.</li>
          <li>In your write-up, list any classmates who helped you figure out the solution. The fact that student A contributed to student B's solution does not necessarily mean that student B contributed to student A's solution.</li>
          <li>Do not post solutions or partial solutions anywhere that your classmates are likely to find them, such as <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/49946/">Ed</a>. You are welcome to use Ed to ask clarification questions and to discuss general concepts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Permitted Resources.</em> In addition to discussions with me, discussions with TAs, and discussions with classmates as discussed above, you may also use the course textbook and any slides or notes posted in the "Course Timeline" section of this webpage. You may not use any other resources. Some examples of prohibited resources are Wikipedia, ChatGPT, and Stack Exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Late Submissions.</em> You are strongly encouraged to complete each problem set within the allotted time. If you don't master the subject matter of a particular problem set by the time the problem set is due, then you might have trouble understanding the topics we discuss in the following classes. Furthermore, if you submit your solutions late, then it might not be possible to give you timely feedback. That being said, I understand that occasionally missing a deadline is inevitable. Late work will receive partial credit based on the following principles.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you submit your solution to a problem \(x\) days late, where \(0 < x < 5\), then your score will be multiplied by \(\sqrt{1 - (x/5)^2}\), with some rounding. The value \(x\) can be fractional. Work turned in five or more days late will ordinarily not receive any credit.</li>
          <li>Saturdays, Sundays, and university holidays are all excluded from the lateness calculation. If you give me sufficiently early notice that you will be observing a religious holiday, then that day will also be excluded from the lateness calculation.</li>
          <li>This late work policy is applied on a problem-by-problem basis. For example, if you submit your solution to problem 1 of a particular problem set on time and you submit your solution to problem 2 of that same problem set one day late, then you will receive full credit for problem 1 and partial credit for problem 2. However, if a problem is divided into parts, then you must submit the solutions to all parts simultaneously.</li>
          <li>The calculation described above might be ambiguous in some cases. Ultimately, I will decide how much credit to grant for late work. In special circumstances, I might grant more credit for late work than what the calculation described above stipulates. Please get in touch with me if you are having trouble keeping up with the course schedule for any reason.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Grading</strong>
          35% problem sets, 25% midterm, 40% final exam.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Academic Honesty Catch-All Policy</strong>
          Even if you have <em>no intention of being dishonest,</em> you might nevertheless find yourself in an "ethically problematic" situation at some point. For example, maybe you and a classmate work together to solve a homework problem, and then <em>afterward</em> you remember that you were supposed to work on the problem on your own for at least ten minutes before collaborating. Or maybe you accidentally stumble upon the solution to a homework problem while reading the textbook for a different course.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such circumstances, you should simply write a note explaining what happened and include it with your submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          I encourage you to follow this simple protocol in every course you take. It is a surefire way to avoid getting in trouble for academic dishonesty. Depending on the circumstances, I might have to take some points off your score, but don't let this deter you. <em>A clean conscience is worth more than any grade.</em>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Accessibility and Accommodations</strong>
          I want all students to be able to fully participate in this course. Let me know if you need an accommodation for any reason, so we can explore possible solutions together. If applicable, please follow the protocols established by UChicago Student Disability Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          To highlight one example, I am happy to work with students who are pregnant/parenting to figure out the best way to make the course work for you.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Inclusion and Atmosphere</strong>
          This course, like every course you take, ought to be an enjoyable and enriching experience. You have a right to be treated with respect and a responsibility to treat others with respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          To highlight one facet of this topic, you are encouraged to ask questions in class, and you should make your classmates feel comfortable asking questions in class. There is no shame in not knowing something or not understanding something. Questions make the course better for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          To highlight another facet, computer scientists can come from many diverse backgrounds, and nobody should experience prejudice or discrimination in this course.
