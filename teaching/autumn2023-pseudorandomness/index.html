          <strong class="toc-item">Course Description</strong>
          What is the role of randomness in computing? Algorithm designers often introduce random choices into their algorithms in an effort to solve problems as efficiently as possible. This is a powerful and valuable paradigm, but it raises the question, where are we supposed to get random bits so that we can run these algorithms? In this course, we will think of randomness as an "expensive" or "scarce" computational resource. All else being equal, an algorithm that uses fewer random bits is better than an algorithm that uses more random bits, just like a faster algorithm is better than a slower algorithm. With this motivation, we will study pseudorandomness, i.e., we will study objects that appear more random than they actually are. We will mainly focus on the theory of unconditional pseudorandom generators, which use a small truly random "seed" to generate a long sequence of bits that appear random to any "sufficiently efficient" observer. Other topics will include randomness extractors, the derandomization of algorithms, and expander graphs.

        <ul>
          <li>65% problem sets (there will be four problem sets throughout the quarter)</li>
          <li>25% project (see below)</li>
          <li>10% participation</li>

          <strong class="toc-item">Collaboration Policy for Problem Sets</strong>
          You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on problem sets. However, you must adhere to the following rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Before discussing a problem with a classmate, you must work on the problem on your own for at least 20 minutes.</li>
          <li>You must write your solution on your own. While writing your solution, you may not consult any notes that you took during a discussion with another classmate.</li>
          <li>In your write-up, you must list any classmates who contributed to your solution through discussion. There will not be any penalty. The fact that A contributed to B's solution does not necessarily mean that B contributed to A's solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Resource Policy for Problem Sets</strong>
          You may use the following resources while working on the problem sets.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>For full credit: </em> The course texts, any course notes that might be posted on this webpage, and your classmates as described in the collaboration policy section.</li>
          <li><em>For partial credit: </em> Anything at all, but you must make a note of which resources you used to solve which problems. You don't need to mention using course texts or course notes. You also don't need to mention it if I help you with a problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here are a few examples of resources that you may <em>not</em> use if you wish to receive full credit on a problem: Wikipedia, ChatGPT, Stack Exchange, research papers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Project</strong>
          Pseudorandomness is an active area of research. There are many important theorems in this area that we won't have time to cover in class, including lots of exciting recent work!
        </p>
        <p>
          You will study one such theorem and write an exposition. You will explain what the theorem means and why it matters, and you will explain some or all of the proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select your theorem from a list that will be provided, or, with permission, you can choose a theorem that is not on the list. Further details TBA.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="toc-item">Academic Honesty Catch-All Policy</strong>
          Students frequently find themselves in "gray area" situations that are not clearly covered by course policies. For example, maybe you accidentally stumble upon the solution to a homework problem while reading the textbook for a different course. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In such circumstances, you should simply write a note explaining what happened and include it with your submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          I encourage you to follow this simple protocol in every course you take. It is a surefire way to avoid getting in trouble for academic dishonesty. Depending on the circumstances, you might receive a grade penalty, but don't let this deter you. <em>A clean conscience is worth more than any grade.</em>
