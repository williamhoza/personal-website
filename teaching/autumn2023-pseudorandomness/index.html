          <div class="indent">
          What is the role of randomness in computing? Algorithm designers often introduce random choices into their algorithms in an effort to solve problems as efficiently as possible. This is a powerful and valuable paradigm, but it raises the question, where are we supposed to get random bits so that we can run these algorithms? In this course, we will think of randomness as an "expensive" or "scarce" computational resource. All else being equal, an algorithm that uses fewer random bits is better than an algorithm that uses more random bits, just like a faster algorithm is better than a slower algorithm. With this motivation, we will study pseudorandomness, i.e., we will study objects that appear more random than they actually are. We will mainly focus on the theory of unconditional pseudorandom generators, which use a small truly random "seed" to generate a long sequence of bits that appear random to any "sufficiently efficient" observer. Other topics will include randomness extractors, the derandomization of algorithms, and expander graphs.

              Pseudorandomness is an active area of research. There are many important theorems in this area that we won't have time to cover in class, including lots of exciting recent work!
            </p>
            <p>
              You will study one such theorem and write an exposition. You will explain what the theorem means and why it matters, and you will explain some or all of the proof.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can select your theorem from a list that will be provided, or, with permission, you can choose a theorem that is not on the list. Further details TBA.
