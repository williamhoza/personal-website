  We give a simple explicit hitting set generator for read-once branching programs of width \(w\) and length \(r\) with known variable order and acceptance probability at least \(\varepsilon\). When \(r = w\), our generator has seed length \(O(\log^2 r + \log(1/\varepsilon))\). When \(r = \text{polylog } w\), our generator has optimal seed length \(O(\log w + \log(1/\varepsilon))\). For intermediate values of \(r\), our generator's seed length smoothly interpolates between these two extremes. Our generator's seed length improves on recent work by Braverman, Cohen, and Garg (SICOMP 2020). In addition, our generator and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the work by Braverman et al. When \(\varepsilon\) is small, our generator's seed length improves on all the classic generators for space-bounded computation (Nisan Combinatorica 1992; Impagliazzo, Nisan, and Wigderson STOC 1994; Nisan and Zuckerman JCSS 1996). However, all of these other works construct more general objects than we do. As a corollary of our construction, we show that every \(\mathbf{RL}\) algorithm that uses \(r\) random bits can be simulated by an \(\mathbf{NL}\) algorithm that uses only \(O(r/ \log^c n)\) nondeterministic bits, where c is an arbitrarily large constant. Finally, we show that any \(\mathbf{RL}\) algorithm with small success probability \(\varepsilon\) can be simulated deterministically in space \(O(\log^{3/2} n + \log n \log \log(1/\varepsilon))\). This space bound improves on work by Saks and Zhou (JCSS 1999), who gave an algorithm for the more general "two-sided" problem that runs in space \(O(\log^{3/2} n + \log n \log(1/\varepsilon ))\).
