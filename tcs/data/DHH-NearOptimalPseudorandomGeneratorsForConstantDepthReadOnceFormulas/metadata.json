The result is that in the conclusion of the lemma, instead of the bound \\(\\Delta(\\phi|_X) \\leq 10\\sqrt{\\Delta(\\phi)} \\log^2(1/\\theta)\\), we should have the bound \\(\\Delta(\\phi|_X) \\leq O(\\sqrt{\\Delta(\\phi)} \\log^2(1/\\theta) + \\log(1/\\epsilon_0))\\). The main results of the paper are unaffected."
