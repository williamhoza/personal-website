We construct improved hitting set generators (HSGs) for ordered (read-once) regular branching programs in two parameter regimes. First, we construct an explicit \(\epsilon\)-HSG for <em>unbounded-width</em> regular branching programs with a single accept state with seed length
    \[
      \widetilde{O}(\log n \cdot \log(1/\epsilon)),
    \]
where \(n\) is the length of the program. Second, we construct an explicit \(\epsilon\)-HSG for width-\(w\) length-\(n\) regular branching programs with seed length
    \[
      \widetilde{O}\left(\log n \cdot \left(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)} + \log w \right) + \log(1/\epsilon)\right).
    \]
For context, the "baseline" in this area is the pseudorandom generator (PRG) by Nisan (Combinatorica 1992), which fools ordered (possibly non-regular) branching programs with seed length \(O(\log(wn/\epsilon) \cdot \log n)\). For regular programs, the state-of-the-art PRG, by Braverman, Rao, Raz, and Yehudayoff (FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014), has seed length \(\widetilde{O}(\log(w/\epsilon) \cdot \log n)\), which beats Nisan's seed length when \(\log(w/\epsilon) = o(\log n)\). Taken together, our two new constructions beat Nisan's seed length in all parameter regimes except when \(\log w\) and \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) are <em>both</em> \(\Omega(\log n)\) (for the construction of HSGs for regular branching programs with a single accept vertex).

Extending work by Reingold, Trevisan, and Vadhan (STOC 2006), we furthermore show that an explicit HSG for regular branching programs with a single accept vertex with seed length \(o(\log^2 n)\) in the regime \(\log w = \Theta(\log(1/\epsilon)) = \Theta(\log n)\) would imply improved HSGs for <em>general</em> ordered branching programs, which would be a major breakthrough in derandomization.  Pyne and Vadhan (CCC 2021) recently obtained such parameters for the special case of permutation branching programs.
