  A "hitting set" is a set of binary strings \(H\) with a guarantee along the following lines: Let \(P\) be any property of binary strings such that (a) many strings have property \(P\) and (b) it's easy to check whether a given string has property \(P\). Then there is at least one string in \(H\) with property \(P\). (What exactly does "easy" mean? That varies depending on context. The meaning of "easy" in the context of our paper is somewhat technical, but it's related to computing with low memory.) In the paper, we present a couple of hitting sets that are smaller than all previously discovered hitting sets in some cases.
