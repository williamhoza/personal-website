  A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits that "appear random" in some sense. To be more specific, in the context of complexity theory, we want the output bits to appear random to any "sufficiently efficient" observer. This is expository work that describes techniques for designing pseudorandom generators.
