  For \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(d = o(\log \log n)\), we prove that there is a Boolean function \(F\) on \(n\) bits and a value \(\gamma = 2^{-\Theta(d)}\) such that \(F\) can be computed by a uniform depth-\((d + 1)\) \(\mathsf{AC}^0\) circuit with \(O(n)\) wires, but \(F\) cannot be computed by any depth-\(d\) \(\mathsf{TC}^0\) circuit with \(n^{1 + \gamma}\) wires. This bound matches the current state-of-the-art lower bounds for computing explicit functions by threshold circuits of depth \(d > 2\), which were previously known only for functions outside \(\mathsf{AC}^0\) such as the parity function. Furthermore, in our result, the \(\mathsf{AC}^0\) circuit computing \(F\) is a monotone <em>read-once formula</em> (i.e., an \({\mathsf{AND}\text{-}\mathsf{OR}}\) tree), and the lower bound holds even in the average-case setting with respect to advantage \(n^{-\gamma}\).

  Our proof builds on the <em>random projection</em> procedure of HÃ¥stad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan, which they used to prove the celebrated average-case depth hierarchy theorem for \(\mathsf{AC}^0\) (J. ACM, 2017). We show that under a modified version of their projection procedure, any depth-\(d\) threshold circuit with \(n^{1 + \gamma}\) wires simplifies to a near-trivial function, whereas an appropriately parameterized \({\mathsf{AND}\text{-}\mathsf{OR}}\) tree of depth \(d + 1\) maintains structure.
