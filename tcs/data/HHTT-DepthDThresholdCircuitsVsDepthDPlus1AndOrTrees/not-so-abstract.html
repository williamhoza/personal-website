  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit">"Boolean circuit"</a> is an idealized network of logic gates and input variables connected by wires. You can assign binary values to the input variables. The values feed into whatever gates are connected to the variables. The outputs of those gates feed into other gates, which feed into other gates, and so on, until eventually the circuit produces a binary output.

  In one basic circuit model, the only available logic gates are "AND" gates and "OR" gates. (An "AND" gate outputs 1 if its inputs are all 1. An "OR" gate outputs 1 if at least one of its inputs is 1.) There is also a more powerful circuit model in which we allow "threshold gates," which compute an arbitrary weighted sum of their input bits and output 1 if the weighted sum is above some threshold. This second type of circuit can be considered a simplified model of a brain.

  What are threshold gates good for? How much additional power do they give you compared to AND/OR gates? It has been known for decades that using threshold gates, it is possible to <em>decrease the depth</em> of a given AND/OR circuit. (The "depth" of a circuit is the length of the longest path from input to output, which can be considered a measure of the amount of time that the computation takes.)

  The caveat is that known depth-reduction methods substantially increase the <em>total number of wires</em> in the circuit, which is a measure of the total amount of work that goes into the computation. In our paper, we prove that increasing the number of wires is unavoidable in general. That is, we prove that decreasing the depth of certain AND/OR circuits using threshold gates <em>requires</em> increasing the number of wires by a non-negligible amount.
