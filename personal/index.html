            I'm a member of the <a href="https://solidarity-party.org/">American Solidarity Party</a>. My views on some specific U.S. issues:
            <ul>
              <li class="l">
                <span>
                  I favor making it very easy to legally immigrate to the U.S. I want the border between the U.S. and Mexico to be similar to the border between Texas and New Mexico. I don't think any special excuse or reason should be required to become a U.S. citizen.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li class="c">
                <span>
                  I support a ban on the destruction of human embryos in laboratories, e.g. in the context of stem cell research or <i>in vitro</i> fertilization. I think we all have dignity and value that doesn't depend on the circumstances of our conception, and I respect persons conceived <i>in vitro</i> as equals, whether they are embryos or adults.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li class="l">
                <span>
                  I favor repealing the second amendment. In the meantime, I support strict gun control laws that are consistent with the second amendment.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li class="c">
                <span>
                  I support a ban on abortion. I think we should use nonviolent methods to support pregnant women. I support government-funded pregnancy centers, and I think the government should ensure that all employed new mothers have access to paid maternity leave. (Here's a <a href="/blog/economic-theory-of-abortion-policies/">relevant blog post</a>. See also: <a href="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com">What's My Pro-Life Line?</a>)

              <li class="l">
                <span>
                  I favor abolishing capital punishment. I also think the prison system is greatly overused. People who commit crimes should face consequences, but years of imprisonment is extreme.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li class="c">
                <span>
                  I support a ban on physician-assisted suicide and all forms of euthanasia.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li class="l">
                <span>
                  I favor giving every citizen the right to vote, regardless of age or criminal history. Yes, I'm serious, regardless of age.

                  I favor making adultery illegal, at <em>least</em> in cases where the non-participating spouse disapproves.

                  I support extensive government regulations and programs designed to protect the environment.

                  I oppose civil same-sex marriage institutions. I recognize that there is nothing shameful about being gay or lesbian or bisexual. I think sexual minorities are among those most harmed by same-sex marriage. I support legislation that protects sexual minorities from unjust discrimination and harrassment.

                  I oppose torture. More generally, I oppose almost all violent actions performed by the U.S. military. I am grateful for the service of those members of the military who honorably and ethically defend the country.

                I oppose efforts by the NSA to weaken widely-used cryptographic software.
